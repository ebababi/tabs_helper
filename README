= TabsHelper

Tabs Helper plugin is an ActionView helper that facilitates the use of the tabs
UI element. Furthermore, each tab may be optionally create a view scope, so to
replicate the actual tab behavour in the controller level.

== Installation

After installing the plugin on the rails enviroment it is required for the
helper's static files to be copied in the public location, for the helper to be
activated in the application controller and for the application layout to
include the CSS files. A generator have been created for those tasks:

    $ rails generate tabs_helper

Nevertheless, it is still required to update the application layout:

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'tabs_helper' %>

and for IE bugs:

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'tabs_helper.ie' %>

== Usage

Tabs are created through the use of the <tt>tabs_for</tt> method. This method
scopes a builder in its provided block that provide the <tt>tab</tt> method,
which, in its turn, defines a tab, along with its optional view scope.

The specified tabs generate the required HTML tags and on the availability of
the plugin provided image and stylesheet resources it completes the UI element.

Tab series cannot be nest, nevertheless they can be characterized as primary
or secondary, and appear alike, by passing <tt>:class => :primary</tt> or
<tt>:class => :secondary</tt> in the rightmost argument of the tabs_for method
which is an option hash. The default for a series is to appear as primary.

=== Examples

This creates a simple tab series:

  <%= tabs_for :tab_series do |t| %>
    <%= t.tab 'First Tab', first_tab_path() %>
    <%= t.tab 'Second Tab', 'http://example.com/second_tab_path' %>
  <% end %>

This creates a tab series with scoped views:
  <%= tabs_for :search do |t| %>
    <%= t.tab 'Simple', search_path(:section => :simple) do %>
      <%= form_tag :search do %>
        Search for: <%= text_field_tag :query %>
      <% end %>
    <% end %>
    <%= t.tab 'Advanced', search_path(:section => :advanced) do %>
      <%= form_tag :search do %>
        Search for: <%= text_field_tag :query %>
        Search private documents: <%= check_box_tag :private %>
      <% end %>
    <% end %>
  <% end %>
